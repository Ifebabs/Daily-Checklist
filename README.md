# Daily Checklist Generator

I made a quick Python script that generates a yearly checklist in Markdown format to use on Obsidian.  
Thought it wouldn't hurt to add to my Github.

## Features
- Interactive task input
- Creates to-do list for entire year (365 days)
- Uses Notion-compatible checkboxes
- Saves output as Markdown file

## Usage
1. Run the script:
```bash
python dailyChecklist.py
```

2. Enter your daily tasks when prompted
3. Type 'done' when finished
4. Find generated checklist in `yearly_checklist.md`

## Output Format
```markdown
Jan 1st:
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

Jan 2nd:
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
```
